          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 1.5vw; text-align: left;">I’m a 21-year-old junior web developer with a passion for technology and coding that started early in life. I was born in Russia, but my family moved to Ukraine when I was five, and I spent the next 15 years growing up there. My parents are missionaries, and their work exposed me to a lot of different experiences from a young age. I got into coding on my own, learning through trial and error, and eventually dove into robotics. I even built a robot that won several competitions! I’m now working as a junior web developer for a Florida-based company that prepares students for the NCMHCE exam, and I've been in this role for two years. 

            Outside of work, I’ve dedicated a lot of time to volunteering. I have five years of experience working with kids in orphanages and spent nine months volunteering in Kherson during the Russian occupation, which was a life-changing experience. I’m also currently a second-year student at LCC International University in Klaipeda, balancing my studies with work. 
            
            In my free time, I love biking, traveling, and tinkering with tech repair. I’m the oldest of four siblings, so I’ve learned to be pretty adaptable!</p>
